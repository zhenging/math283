### Section 15.4 Green's Theorem

#### Circulation Form of Green's Theorem
Let $C$ be a simple closed smooth curve, oriented counterclockwise, that encloses a connected and simply connected region $R$ in the plane. Assume $F = \la f, g \ra$, where $f$ and $g$ have continuous first partial derivatives in $R$. Then
$$
\begin{aligned}
\oint_C F\cdot dr = \oint_C fdx + gdy = \iint_R (\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}) dA
\end{aligned}
$$

##### Two-Dimensional Curl
The two-dimensional curl of the vector field $F = \langle f, g \rangle$ is $\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$. If the curl is zero throughout a region, the vector field is said to be **irrotational** on that region.
