### Section 15.3 Conservative Vector Fields

#### Types of Curves and Regions

#### Test for conservative Vector Field
There exists a potential function $\varphi$ such that $F = \nabla\varphi$.

#### Finding Potential Functions

#### Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals and Path Independence
Let $F$ be a continuous vector field on an open connnected region \in $\R^2$ (or $D$ in $\R^3$). There exists a potential function $\varphi$ with $F = \nabla\varphi$ (which means) that $F$ is conservative if and only if
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_C F\cdot T s = \int_C F\cdot dr = \varphi (B) - \varphi (A),
\end{aligned}
$$
for all points $A$ and $B$ in $R$ and all smooth oriented curves $C$ from $A$ and $B$.
