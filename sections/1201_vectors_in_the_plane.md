31\. $w-3v$

32\. $10u - 3v + w$

43\. Express $\vec{QR}$ in the form of $ai + bj$,

45\. Find two unit vectors parallel to $\vec{PR}$.

51\. **Airplane in a wind** An airplane flies horizontally from east to west at 320 mi/hr relative to the air. If it flies in a steady 40 mi/hr wind that blows horizontally toward the southwest ($45\degree$ south of west), find the speed and direction of the airplane relative to the ground.

52\. **Canoe in a current** A woman in a canoe paddles due west at 4 mi/hr relative to the water in a current that flows northwest at 2 mi/hr. Find the speed and direction of the canoe relative to the shore.

57\. **Suspended load** If a 500-lb load is suspended by two chains (see figure), what is the magnitude of the force each chain must be able to withstand?

58\. **Net force** Three forces are applied to an object, as shown in the figure. Find the magnitude and direction of the sum of the forces.

61\. **Unit vectors**
a. Find two unit vectors parallel to $v=6i-8j$.
b. Find $b$ if $v=\langle \frac{1}{3}, b\rangle$ is a unit vector.

71\. $7u+3v = i, u-v = j$

80\. **Mass on a plane** A 100-kg object rests on an inclined plane at an angle of $30\degree$ to the floor. Find the components of the force perpendicular to and parallel to the plane. (The vertical component of the force exerted by an object of mass m is its weight, which is mg, where $g = 9.8 m/s^2$ is the acceleration due to gravity.)

87\. **Magnitude of scalar multiple** Prove that $|cv| = |c| |v|$, where $c$ is a scalar and $v$ is a vector.
